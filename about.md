About Prom Date:
The app was originally built as a simple static app during the inaugural BowTie Springboard contest. The founders of BowTie.io liked it so much that we asked the creator to deploy it as a demo. If you want to see how PromDate works, take a gander at our github page, or get in read the [BowTie Docs](https://bowtie.io/docs#) - but don't be a creep.
